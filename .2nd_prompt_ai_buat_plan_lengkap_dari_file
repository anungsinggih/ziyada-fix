# PHASE 1 ORCHESTRATION — TASK PLANNING (STEP 1)

Context has been LOCKED from the previous step.

Your task now is to transform the implementation rules into an executable plan.
Do NOT write code yet.

---

## 1) Primary Source of Truth
Use **ONLY** this document as the execution source:
- `.agent/rules/IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST_PHASE_1.md`

Other documents are for constraints, not for adding tasks.

---

## 2) What You Must Do
Convert the checklist into a **strictly ordered execution plan**.

For EACH task, define:
- Task ID (stable, sequential)
- Module (DB / RPC / Service API / UI / Reporting)
- Description (what is being implemented)
- Files to touch (exact paths if known)
- Dependencies (task IDs)
- Acceptance Criteria (binary: pass/fail)
- Required Test Scenario

---

## 3) Execution Rules
- Do NOT add tasks outside the checklist
- Do NOT merge multiple checklist items into one task
- Do NOT reorder tasks unless there is a hard dependency
- If a checklist item is unclear, mark it as a BLOCKER (do not assume)

---

## 4) Output Format (STRICT)

## PHASE 1 TASK PLAN

### Module: Database
- [ ] T1 — …
- [ ] T2 — …

### Module: RPC / Posting Engine
- [ ] T…

### Module: Service API
- [ ] T…

### Module: UI
- [ ] T…

### Module: Reporting & Period Close
- [ ] T…

## TASK DETAIL

### Task ID: T1
- Module:
- Description:
- Files to touch:
- Depends on:
- Acceptance Criteria:
- Test Scenario:

(repeat for all tasks)

## BLOCKERS (if any)
- …

## Completion Condition
Stop after producing the full task plan.
Do NOT execute any task yet.

Begin now.
