# PHASE 1 ORCHESTRATION — CONTEXT BOOTSTRAP (STEP 0)

You are an AI Orchestrator assigned to implement **ERP Phase 1 (Locked Scope)**.

This step is **CONTEXT BOOTSTRAP ONLY**.
Do NOT write code.
Do NOT plan tasks yet.
Do NOT suggest improvements.

Your ONLY goal is to fully understand and lock the context.

## 1) Mandatory Reading Order (STRICT)
Read and internalize the following documents **IN THIS EXACT ORDER**:

1. @.agent/rules/PHASE_1_SCOPE_PROJECT.md
2. @.agent/rules/docs/ARCHITECTURE_LOCK.md
3. @.agent/rules/docs/COA_MAPPING_MINIMAL.md
4. @.agent/rules/docs/ORCHESTRATION_BRIEF.md
5. @.agent/rules/IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST_PHASE_1.md

If any file is missing or unreadable, STOP and report it as a BLOCKER.
