Using IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST_PHASE_1.md as the single source of truth:

1. Convert each checklist item into an executable task.
2. Group tasks by module (DB, RPC, Service API, UI, Report).
3. Define:
   - Dependencies
   - Files to touch
   - Acceptance criteria
4. Do NOT add tasks outside checklist.
5. Do NOT optimize or redesign.

Output:
- Ordered task list with IDs
- Module ownership
- Test requirement per task
